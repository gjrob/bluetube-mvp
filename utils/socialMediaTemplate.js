🚁 Announcing BlueTubeTV: A Specialized Streaming Platform for the Drone Industry

After months of development, we're excited to launch BlueTubeTV - a streaming platform designed specifically for drone operators and enthusiasts.

Key Features:
• Direct integration with DJI and Autel applications
• Built-in FAA Part 107 compliance tracking
• No content strikes for ambient motor noise
• Monetization through tips and NFT moments
• Enterprise solutions for commercial operators

Why we built this:
Traditional platforms weren't designed for drone content. Pilots face copyright strikes for motor noise, poor compression for aerial footage, and no tools for compliance documentation.

BlueTubeTV solves these industry-specific challenges while creating new revenue opportunities for professional pilots.

🎯 First 100 users receive exclusive founder badges and lifetime premium features.

Title: [Launch] BlueTubeTV - Twitch for Drones (No More YouTube Strikes!)

Hey r/drones!

Just launched BlueTubeTV - a streaming platform built specifically for drone pilots. 

**The Problem:** YouTube strikes you for motor noise. Twitch compresses your 4K to potato quality. Facebook... is Facebook.

**What We Built:**
- Stream directly from DJI Fly/Autel apps
- No copyright strikes (we know motors make noise)
- FAA compliance tracking built-in
- Tips/NFTs for monetization
- DRONE CAMERAS ONLY (sorry, no gaming streams)

**For the First 100 Pilots:**
- Exclusive founder badge
- Lifetime premium features
- Direct input on new features

We're in beta, so expect some bugs. But we're building this WITH the community.

Check it out: www.bluetubetv.live
